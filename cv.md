## about me

<I'm 36 years old. I live in Ukraine, in the small town of Lyubotin, this is the Kharkov region.He studied to be a cook, at a school, but did not work by profession. He mostly worked in factories.\ But on February 24, 2022, everything changed. A war began in my country, Russia began a massive shelling of cities and my hometown of Kharkov began to turn into ruins, factories stopped working. So I was left without a job. I started trying to learn programming, at first on my own, but I realized that it would not work on my own and turned to a friend who advised RSSchool courses
